# Convertoing pdf to png with frontend

## Getting Started
To do this task you’ll need to have basic knowledge of ReactJS and JavaScript. We’ll use Create React App to scaffold our project, so make sure it’s installed on your machine.

## Steps
Here are the steps we will follow to build this app:

1) Set up a new React project using Create React App.
2) Download the required dependencies: pdfjs.
3) Create a form for users to upload a PDF file.
4) Use pdfjs to convert the PDF to a series of images.
5) Display the images and allow users to download or share them.

### Step 1: Create a new React app

First, open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:

`npx create-react-app pdf-to-image-converter`

Once the app is created, navigate into the project directory:

`cd pdf-to-image-converter`

### Step 2: Download required files

Next, download the pdf.js files for the project from https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pdf.js/2.6.347

pdfjs is a JavaScript library for working with PDF files
